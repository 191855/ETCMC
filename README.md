Step 1: Download the latest zip file from this link and unzip it

Step 2: Open the new folder: 'Etcmcnodecheck' and edit the 'etcmcnodemonitoringid.txt' file (right click and select edit).

Note: if you changed the default installation folder of your GETH client, please edit the 'gethclient-folder' text file and replace the text with the correct folder.

Step 3: Copy the monitoring ID you created with /newnode and replace the text in the file you just opened in step 2. Save and close this file.

Step 4: Start the monitoring by running the 'check-node' batch file (not as administrator!). Your done! Dont forget to repeat step 4 when your system has rebooted.

If you ran into any problems please use /help for some tips.
